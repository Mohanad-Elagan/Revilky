# Revilky

***Revilky was a project made as a part of a solution for the challenge "A Comparative Analysis" in [EO Dashboard Hackathon 2021](https://www.eodashboardhackathon.org/) by NASA.
This project was to be #1 in Africa & Middle East and nominated to be a global finalist.***

## Revilky Summary
*The COVID-19 pandemics affected the economy of many countries causing many troubles in their economic system. A comparative analysis was done between some continents taking their major countries, for example, the USA, France, and Japan before and after COVID-19 in two different criteria, economic impacts and air quality. For example, more than one billion passengers in the USA were removed representing a decline of 64.4% of global passenger traffic due to COVID-19. In France, the amount of NO<sub>2</sub>, NO, and CO levels in the air, were reduced by 67%, 78%, and 62%, respectively, resulting in an 80% reduction in road traffic.*
